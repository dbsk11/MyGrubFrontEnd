## How It Works

A user is able to browse available restaurants by cuisine, browse through the menu by category, and add desired food items to their cart.

## Built Using?

MyGrub was built with a Rails backend which handles user authentication as well as collection/provision of movie data and trailers. The frontend is built with vanilla Javascript which neatly displays the restaurants by cuisine, menu items by category, and the users cart.

## Software Requirements

- Ruby on Rails

## How to Run (frontend)

- Clone this repo as well as the [backend repo](https://github.com/dbsk11/MyGrubBackEnd), navigate to the project root in your terminal.
